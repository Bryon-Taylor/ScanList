# ScanList
ScanList is a list creation app that allows the user to enter list items traditionally 
through typing as well as through faster input methods such as scanned voice entries 
and scanned images taken from the phone's camera for text.

Traditional typed input
Tap in the EditText box at the top and manually enter input. Tap the "plus" button
to add the item to your list.

Voice recognition input
Tap the microphone icon in the action bar at the top and speak to enter input. The
spoken result will appear in the EditText box. Tap the "plus" button to add the item.

Image scanning input
Tap the camera icon in the action bar at the top to launch the phone's camera. Take a 
picture of a list (such as a recipe). Tap "ok" or "retry". Once "ok" is tapped the image
cropping tool will appear. Crop the image to only include information you want to add
to your list and tap "crop". 
Any detected text will appear in a new list. You can tap "add all" at the bottom and all
of the items will be added to your existing list. Each item is also editable so you can
make changes before adding it. You can also add individual items by tapping the "plus" 
button to the right of it. Swipe left or right to delete items from this list. Tapping 
the "add all" or "done" button will return you to the main list.

While in the main list, you can swipe right to delete an item. Doing so will show a 
snackbar at the bottom that will allow the opportunity to undo the deletion. Swiping left
on an item will allow you to edit it. Long pressing an item will allow you to drag the 
item to reorder it in the list. Tapping an item's checkbox will "grey out" the item to
indicate it has been "crossed off". Clicking the overflow menu icon in the action bar will
reveal the option to delete all the checked items at once. There is also the option to
delete all items.

If you want to share your list, tap the "share" icon in the action bar. Select the app 
that you want share with i.e. email app, messaging app.
